					<h3>Predicting Employee Attrition</h3>
					<p>“People are companies’ most important assets” (Altman, 2017) and the cost to replace
						those assets is astonishing. “Josh Bersis of Deloitte believes the cost of losing an employee can
						range from tens of thousands of dollars to 1.5 – 2.0x the employee’s annual salary” (Altman,
						2017). If it is possible to predict which employees will leave the company and the potential
						reasons why, it can save companies hundreds of thousands of dollars. Also, by identifying the
						reasons why an employee might leave the company, the analysis can direct the company to make
						the necessary changes to increase employee morale and make a happier and more productive
						work place.
						<br>
						The question we want to answer is: What are the most likely reasons for an employee to
						leave a company and can the turnover possibility be predicted before it happens? Appearing
						simple at first, the question demands the consideration of various factors when attempting to
						determine whether one variable has a greater influence than another. </p>
